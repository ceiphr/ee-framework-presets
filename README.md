# EasyEffects Framework Presets

These EasyEffects presets are based off conversations on the Framework community site for the Framework Laptop: [Speakers sound quality](https://community.frame.work/t/speakers-sound-quality)

The name of the preset is the username of the creator on that community thread. I've been using Kieran Levin's flat preset (`kieran_levin.json`).

How do I import these? [Read here](https://github.com/Digitalone1/EasyEffects-Presets#how-to-install).

You will need [EasyEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) for this.
